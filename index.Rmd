## Bio

My name is Simon and I currently live in Basel. I am doing my Masters degree in Psychology and another passion of mine is painting, drawing and photography. 
I have always loved drawing and painting ever since I was young and as I grew up there did not seem to be sufficient time for it. 
Photography I started before even realising it and always found taking pictures or imagining what a picture might look like very peaceful. 
The whole procedure of art and photography is rewarding in so many different aspects.
